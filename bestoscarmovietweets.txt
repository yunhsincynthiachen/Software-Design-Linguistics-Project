If American Hustle and Christian Bale do not win Oscars I don't know what will. The Welshman was OUTSTANDING #AmericanHustle

@LandmarkLTC @TheAcademy Personally, I would love #Her to win, but #12YearsASlave will and should win BP. #Oscars
I feel like #AmericanHustle will win. I don't really want it to. #Her was awesome but won't get it. #Oscars
The #Oscars are tomorrow night! Do you think "12 Years a Slave" will win Best Picture? http://t.co/cXLxaQn7ur
Are the Oscars progressive on race? @Ctblauvelt on what a best picture win for 12 Years a Slave will mean: http://t.co/KQwwtmoBza
@MsSarahPaulson I am so proud of you and the 12 Years A Slave cast! The Oscars are airing here tomorrow and I'm watching them! YOU WILL WIN!
Oscar prediction: 12 Years A Slave will win. Still have to see it, though. #Oscars
RT @EntMagazine: Voters say “12 Years a Slave” will win Best Picture &amp; Alfonso Cuarón Best Director. Do you agree? Vote now at http://t.co/…
12 Years a Slave will win #BestPicture tomorrow. Why? Because we tried to see it and it's sold out. #Oscars #drats
I'd set the over/under on the number of Oscars that '12 Years a Slave' will win at '3.5'. I think it can even win FOUR though.
Happy for 12 Years a Slave win at the Independent Movie Awards! I hope Oscars will follow!

@StrategyDC Philomena is my favourite, but I think 12 Years a Slave will win. #Oscars
Will NEBRASKA win Best Original Screenplay? http://t.co/RIwIr2RQoB #screenwriting #Oscars #BobNelson
I don't think it will win many #Oscars, but #Nebraska is officially my favorite movie of the year. Beautiful simple storytelling. My heart.
